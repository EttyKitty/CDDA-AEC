# CDDA-AEC
 An Armor Efficiency Calculator + table generator for the Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.

 An already created table exists on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/EttyKitty/CDDA-AEC/wiki/Armor-Efficiency-Table).
 
 Items with "copy-from" are ignored for now. It's not hard to add their support and I'll do it as soon as the spark of good mood hits me.  
 Items with "portion" in the "material" are ignored as well. Again, I already know how to implement them - waiting for a spark.
